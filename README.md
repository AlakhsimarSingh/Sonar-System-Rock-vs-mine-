> Sonar Data Classification Project
This is my first ML project, it aims to classify underwater objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data using logistic regression. The dataset contains sonar signals bounced off various objects in the water, and the task is to differentiate between rocks and mines.

> Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the file sonar_data.csv. It consists of 60 features representing different signal frequencies and their strengths, and the target variable indicating whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

> Requirements
To run this project, you need:
Python 3.x
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:

The script loads the dataset, splits it into training and test sets, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its performance on both sets. Finally, it predicts the label of a new sonar data instance and prints whether it's a rock or a mine.

> Results
The accuracy of the logistic regression model on the training and test sets is printed to the console. Additionally, the prediction for a sample sonar data instance is printed, indicating whether it corresponds to a rock or a mine.
